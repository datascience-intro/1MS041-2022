## Introduction to Data Science 1MS041

You can download the Lecture notes [here](https://datascience-intro.github.io/1MS041-2022/Files/LectureNotes1MS041.pdf).


### Introductory SageMath Jupyter .ipynb Notebooks
These notebooks contain the basic theory of how to work with Sagemath and python, that will be needed in this course.

A01. [A01-BASH_Unix_Shell](A01-BASH_Unix_Shell.md)

### Individual SageMath Jupyter .ipynb lecture Notebooks

These notebooks are numbered according to which lecture they coincide with and will be updated after the lectures. Before the lecture they can be considered preliminary.

01. [01-Probability](01-Probability.md)
02. [02-Random_Variables](02-Random_Variables.md)
02. [02-Random_Variables_examples](02-Random_Variables_examples.md)
03. [03-Random_Variables](03-Random_Variables.md)
04. [04-Concentration_and_Limits](04-Concentration_and_Limits.md)
05. [05-Limits](05-Limits.md)
05. [05-Risk](05-Risk.md)
06. [06-Fundamentals_of_estimation](06-Fundamentals_of_estimation.md)
07. [07-Estimation_Likelihood](07-Estimation_Likelihood.md)

### Problem Solving Sessions

These notebooks are numbered according to which problem solving session they coincide with.

02. [02-ProbSS1](02-ProbSS1.md)
03. [03-ProbSS2](03-ProbSS2.md)
07. [07-ProbSS4_Estimation](07-ProbSS4_Estimation.md)

### Starting package
* Download the [Starting package](Files/first_lecture_and_data.zip)
* Unzip this into a folder that you will use as the base folder
* Whenever you download the next lectures as `ipynb` files, you put them in the same place as `*.ipynb`, this way all pathways will be the same for all of us.

### Assignment notebooks

1. [Assignment_1](Assignment_1.md)
2. [Assignment_2](Assignment_2.md)
